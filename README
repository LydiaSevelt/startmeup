Startmeup

Simple script and templates to add an LSB complient start/stop script to /etc/init.d/ 
creating a config file in /etc/conf.d/

Usage:

-h  Show this help
-b  Full path to daemon binary

Everything below here is optional
Remember to use single quotes to preserve literal strings

-e  Enable newly installed start/stop script in default runlevels
	Executes "update-rc.d enable" for new script after install
-f  Force overwrite of existing script/config files
-U  Full path to daemon binary - Update
	Some config file changes require running update to push
	changes to the init script. Also checks templates and will
	update script and config file if newer versions are available.
	Updating from templates requires -f

-n  "Provides" name
	Default is the binary name
-c  Full path to config file
-p  Full path to pidfile if the daemon creates one
-r  Special reload command if daemon does not accept HUP signal
-o  Command line arguments to pass to binary when executing
-E  Short description of daemon
-s  Startup runlevels
	Default is '3 4 5'
-S  Stop runlevels
	Default is '0 1 6'
-d  Should start services
-D  Should stop services
-q  Required startup services
	Remember to use single quotes to preserve the literal string
	Default is '$network $local_fs $remote_fs'
-Q  Required shutdown services
	Remember to use single quotes to preserve the literal string
	Default is '$network $local_fs $remote_fs'

Examples:

	For most people the defaults will be sufficient:

startmeup -b /usr/sbin/thingd

	Many people will want to add the new deamon to startup at the same time

startmeup -b /usr/sbin/thingd -e

	Some daemons create a pidfile when they run, use that for added reliability

startmeup -b /usr/sbin/thingd -e -p /var/run/thingd.pid

	Pass some command line options to the daemon and add a short description

startmeup -b /usr/sbin/thingd -e -p /var/run/thingd.pid -o "-v --debug=2 -e" -E "The thingd daemon for things"

	Add additional runtime requirements and only change the default runlevels to start daemon
	Don't forget the single quotes so that the requirments are treated as literal strings and not interpreted as variables

startmeup -b /usr/sbin/thingd -e -p /var/run/thingd.pid -o "-v --debug=2 -e" -E "The thingd daemon for things" -s "5" -q '$network $local_fs $remote_fs $syslog libvirtd sshd'


TODO:

- Testing - validate current template functions as a proper drop in replacement for other start/stop scripts.
- More testing of Update function required
- Add check function to see if files need updating
- Fix paths
- Package up
- create /etc/conf.d/
- improve start/stop script template
- Additional insserv integration, view start order, etc
- support --make-pidfile properly
- man page
- detailed example usage, both for -h and the man page
